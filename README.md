# Go≈∫dzik the Game - powered by NEAT algorithm

## Introduction

I decided to use NEAT (Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies) to teach a Feed Forward neural network model to play a platform game. It connects genetic algorithms with the power of neural networks which I've found fascinating. The notion behind NEAT is to encode neural networks as chromosomes and improve them through evolution using fitness function as a metric. It's a powerful tool for various reinforcement learning tasks.

## NEAT

It was initially introduced in [this paper](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.cec02.pdf) by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen from The University of Texas. Basic rules of this algorithm:
1. Start with a population of neural networks with random weights
2. Calculate fitness for every network
3. Crossover best networks with each others
4. Mutate networks with some probablity 
   5. Mutate by adding new node 
   6. Mutate by deleting node
   7. Mutate by adding connection
   8. Mutate by deleting connection
